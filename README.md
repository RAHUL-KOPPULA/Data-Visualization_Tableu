# Data Visualization & Storytelling – Superstore Sales Analysis

## Overview
This project is a part of the **Data Analyst Internship Task 2**, focused on mastering the art of **data visualization and storytelling**. Using Tableau, I explored and visualized sales data from a fictional retail chain – *Superstore* – to uncover business insights and craft a compelling visual narrative.

## Tools Used
- **Tableau Desktop** (for interactive dashboard creation)
- **Microsoft Excel** / CSV (data formatting)
- **GitHub** (project documentation and submission)

## Dataset
**Superstore.csv**  
The dataset contains retail sales information including:
- Order details (Order ID, Date)
- Customer segments
- Sales, profit, discount, and quantity
- Geographical data (Region, State, City)
- Product details (Category, Sub-Category, Product Name)

## Key Visualizations & Insights

### 1. **Sales Over Time**
- Monthly trend of sales to observe growth patterns
- Highlighted seasonal performance peaks

### 2. **Profit by Sub-Category**
- Identified most and least profitable product types
- Categories like **Copiers** had high profit margins, while **Tables** showed losses

### 3. **Sales vs. Profit by Region**
- Regional breakdown revealed **Central region** struggling with profitability
- Compared high-sales vs low-profit zones

### 4. **Top 10 Products by Profit**
- Ranked products driving the most profit
- Informed future stocking or marketing strategies

### 5. **Customer Segment Analysis**
- Sales and profit distribution across segments: **Consumer**, **Corporate**, and **Home Office**
- Corporate had steady returns, while Home Office showed inconsistent profit

## Storytelling & Dashboard Design
- Clean, minimal dashboard layout
- Contextual annotations on key charts
- Filters for interactivity (Region, Segment)
- Color-coded to highlight performance (Green = High Profit, Red = Loss)

---

## Summary of Findings
- **Technology** leads in sales and profit, especially in B2B segments
- **Tables** sub-category needs cost review due to consistent losses
- **West and East** regions drive the majority of revenue
- Promotional discounts often reduce profit — needs re-evaluation
